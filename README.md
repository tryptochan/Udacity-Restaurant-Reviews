# Udacity Project - Restaurant Reviews App

Build a restaurant reviews application with a focus on accessibility. The application must include restaurant names, a photograph, address and operating hours for each restaurant along with reviews, including the name of the reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating system, and comments. The application must include an application header, a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants. When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews must be displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
